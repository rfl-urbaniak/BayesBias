1. Cosine-based measures of bias

  1.1 talk a bit about bias (put deep philosophical issues aside)
  1.2 introduce word embeddings
  1.25 talk about the semantical interpretation, triangle inequality [papers from backlog], focus on difference in distance, no matter whether to be interpreted semantically 
  1.28 General challenges from Boston presentation
  1.3 introduce WEAT and the results in Caliskan
  1.4 introduce MAC and the results from that paper
     
    
2. Some methodological challenges

2.1 WEAT
- no control, no human 
- interpretation (threshold, violin plots?) (?)

2.2 MAC
- no control, no human 
- interpretation (threshold)



3. Pre-averaging and manufactured certainty 

  3.1 General problem with pre-averaging
  3.2 Simulations for WEAT and MAC
  
  
4. Bayesian method
 
  4.05 Bernstein from Boston presentation
  4.07 chasing metrics, priest vs muslim accross models
  4.1. Generally about bayesian method
  4.2. Existing applications to NLP and perhaps to bias
  4.3. Explanation of how we go about this in our model building
  
5. Results
  
  5.1 WEAT vs. 3 embeddingi
  5.2 MAC vs. 3 embeddingi

6. Discussion & summary
  
  
7. APPENDIX

  7.1 examples of WEAT and MAC calculations
  
  7.2 word lists
  
  
  [MAYBE]
  - curse of dimensionality
